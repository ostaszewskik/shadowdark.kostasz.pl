# Travel in the Sands

Roll once each day for wind and temperature conditions.
Travel during the day is **unsafe** (check for random encounters
every 3 hours).
Travel at night is **risky** (check for encounters every 2 hours), and
visibility is reduced to near.

## Temperature

**Hot**. If PCs travel in hot or hotter weather, they must consume an extra ration that day. Pushed mounts (see Movement), must also consume an
extra ration.

**Inferno**. Traveling creatures take 1d6 damage each hour.

## Wind

**Driving**. Travel speed is halved. Navigation checks are one step harder than normal.

**Sandstorm**. Lasts 1d4 days (don't reroll for wind until it completes). Travel is impossible. No visibility.
